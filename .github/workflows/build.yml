  # The pre_job uses a smart Github action that will check the provided path filters 
  # to determine if subsequent jobs should be "skipped" when the filters don't apply.
  # This ensures that our Github branch protection rules are still satisfied and users
  # can merge their PRs with skipped status checks where appropriate.
  # It also provides the ability to cancel outdated workflow runs after branch pushes.
