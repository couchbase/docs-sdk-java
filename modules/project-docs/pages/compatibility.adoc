= Compatibility of Couchbase Features, Couchbase Server Versions, and the Couchbase Java SDK
:navtitle: Compatibility
:page-aliases: ROOT:overview,ROOT:compatibility-versions-features,compatibility-versions-features

[abstract]
Features available in different SDK versions, and compatibility between Server and SDK.
Plus notes on Cloud, networks, and AWS Lambda.

The 3.0 SDK requires Java 8 or later to be installed, earlier versions will not work. 
_Java 11 is recommended_, which has various enhancements like lambda local variable type inference, profiling tools, and updated security features. 
Most of the flavors available will do, although we may only provide support for OpenJDK and Oracle JDK going forward. 
The Java SDK _has not been tested (and is not supported on) Java 12 or later_.


== Couchbase Version/SDK Version Matrix

Couchbase SDKs are tested against a variety of different environments to ensure both backward and forward compatibility with different versions of Couchbase Server.
The matrix below denotes the version of Couchbase Server, the version of the Java SDK and whether the SDK is:

* ✖ *Unsupported*: This combination is not tested, and is not within the scope of technical support if you have purchased a support agreement.
* ◎ *Compatible*: This combination has been tested previously, and should be compatible.
This combination is not recommended by our technical support organization.
It is best to upgrade either the SDK or the Couchbase version you are using.
* ✔ *Supported*:This combination is subject to ongoing quality assurance, and is fully supported by our technical support organization.

[#jdk-compat]
== JDK Version Compatibility

The Java SDK is tested with Oracle JDK and OpenJDK.
Other JDK implementations might work but are not tested and are unsupported.
We recommend running the latest LTS version (i.e. at the time of writing JDK 11) with the highest patch version available.

We only support LTS versions of Oracle JDK and OpenJDK.
Other versions, such as JDK 12, may work -- _but they are not tested and they are not supported_.

The following JDK releases are supported:

* https://adoptopenjdk.net/[OpenJDK 11 with HotSpot JVM] (recommended)
* https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html[Oracle JDK 11 (recommended)]
* https://adoptopenjdk.net/[OpenJDK 1.8 with HotSpot JVM]
* https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html[Oracle JDK 1.8]

Please make sure you run on one of the latest patch releases, since they provide stability improvements and security fixes in general.

[#spring-compat]
== Spring Data Couchbase Compatibility

https://projects.spring.io/spring-data-couchbase/[Spring Data Couchbase^] uses the Java SDK underneath and as a result is also provides different compatibilities with Couchbase Server.
The following table provides an overview.

| | SDC 3.x | SDC 4.0 & 4.1

| _Status >_
| _SDK 2.x only_

| *Recommended*

| *Server 6.5*
| SDK 2.x
| *Recommended*
|===

NOTE: Check the Spring Data Couchbase's compile dependencies -- older versions may link an out-of-date version of the Java SDK in their dependencies list, although a supported version should be in the `updates`.
Please make sure that you are using a supported version of the Couchbase Java SDK, prefereably the latest version, which will contain any available bug fixes.
Using the latest Spring Data Couchbase should ensure that this is so.

[CAUTION]
.Reactor Core Version
====
SpringBoot may set the io.projectreactor version at an earlier virsion than the one needed by the current version of https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.couchbase.client/core-io/2.0.7/jar[Couchbase JVM Core IO]. 
In case of errors, override with Core IO's preferred version, e.g.:

----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.projectreactor</groupId>
    <artifactId>reactor-core</artifactId>
    <version>3.3.5.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
