This page features the release notes for that library -- for release notes, download links, and installation methods for the latest 3.x Java SDK releases, see xref:sdk-release-notes.adoc[the current Release Notes page].


== Using Distributed Transactions

See the xref:7.0@server:learn:data/transactions.adoc[Distributed ACID Transactions concept doc] in the server documentation for details of how Couchbase implements transactions.
The xref:howtos:distributed-acid-transactions-from-the-sdk.adoc[Distributed Transactions HOWTO doc] walks you through all aspects of working with Distributed Transactions.

== Distributed Transactions Java 1.2.3 (15 February 2022)

This release has been tested with Couchbase Java SDK version 3.2.5 and requires version 3.1.5 or higher.

https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-transactions-java-1.2.3/[JavaDocs]

The headline change in this release is that the library's thread safety has been signficantly improved.
Prior to this release the library was thread-safe, but had to be used in a specific documented way to be so.
Now those restrictions have been removed, and the documentation has been updated to reflect it.

=== Improvements
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-258[TXNJ-258],
https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-326[TXNJ-326],
https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-252[TXNJ-252],
https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-454[TXNJ-454]:
Multiple improvements to thread safety, described above.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-368[TXNJ-368]:
The application's lambda is now run on a dedicated Reactive scheduler.
This will help to prevent issues if the lambda runs a blocking non-Couchbase operation (which it should not do).
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-453[TXNJ-453]:
Performance: the thread-safe logging list has been replaced with a faster alternative.

=== Bug Fixes
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-447[TXNJ-447]:
Deferred commit no longer fails with a `NullPointerException`.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-452[TXNJ-452],
https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-460[TXNJ-460],
https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-461[TXNJ-461],
https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-464[TXNJ-464],
https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-465[TXNJ-465]:
Multiple fixes to the reactive version of `ctx.query()`, particularly around error handling.
Any users of this API should upgrade immediately.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-455[TXNJ-455]:
Avoid `ErrorCallbackNotImplemented` errors during cleanup shutdown when metadata collections were in use.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-467[TXNJ-467]:
The single query transaction is completely rewritten, and now performs the `tximplicit` optimisation as expected.


== Distributed Transactions Java 1.2.2 (29 October 2021)

This release has been tested with Couchbase Java SDK version 3.2.2 and requires version 3.1.5 or higher.

https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-transactions-java-1.2.2/[JavaDocs]

=== Interface Changes
Some interfaces that were in `@Stability.Volatile` or `@Stability.Uncommitted` have been modified:

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-442[TXNJ-442]:
`ReactiveQueryStatementTransactionResult` has been been renamed to `ReactiveSingleQueryTransactionResult`, consistent with the blocking API.
This new interface added in 1.2.1 is marked at @Stability.Uncommitted, indicating that breakages - though unusual - are possible.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-445[TXNJ-445]:
An overload `Mono<ReactiveQueryResult> query(final ReactiveScope scope, final String statement)` was added, to be consistent with the blocking API.

=== Bug Fixes
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-436[TXNJ-436],
https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-446[TXNJ-446]:
Rollback and commit now consistently set `isDone` in queryMode, preventing implicit commit.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-444[TXNJ-444]:
Fixed an incorrectly formatted error message that was causing a `MissingFormatArgumentException`.


== Distributed Transactions Java 1.2.1 (21 July 2021)

This release has been tested with Couchbase Java SDK version 3.2.0 and requires version 3.1.5 or higher.

It promotes the beta-level support for using query statements in a transaction to fully committed, as well as the custom metadata collection feature.
The exception to this is the newly-added support for single query transactions.
As this feature is so new, it remains at `@Stability.Uncommitted`.

https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-transactions-java-1.2.1/[JavaDocs]

=== Interface Changes
Some interfaces that were in @Stability.Volatile or @Stability.Uncommitted were modified:

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-424[TXNJ-424]:
The majority of the query API, and custom metadata collections, are promoted to `@Stability.Committed`.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-434[TXNJ-434]:
Reactive query API now takes a `ReactiveScope` rather than `Scope`, for consistency with reactive operations.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-425[TXNJ-425], https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-433[TXNJ-433]:
`Timeout`, `parentSpan` and `retryStrategy` were removed from `TransactionQueryOptions`.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-284[TXNJ-284]:
The transaction expiration time, and key value timeout, can now be configured at the `PerTransactionConfigBuilder` level.

=== Improvements
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-409[TXNJ-409],
https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-410[TXNJ-410],
https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-408[TXNJ-408]:
Improvements to the support for query, including `OpenTelemetry`.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-417[TXNJ-417]:
The client record documents now contain additional diagnostic information.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-420[TXNJ-420]:
`OpenTelemetry` spans now set a status if they have failed (required Java SDK 3.2.0).
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-423[TXNJ-423],
https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-431[TXNJ-431]:
Support for single query statement transactions added at `@Stability.Uncommitted` level.

=== Bug Fixes
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-413[TXNJ-413]:
Lost cleanup threads could restart after the `Transactions` object was shutdown.
This issue is unlikely to affect applications.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-426[TXNJ-426]:
Fix span.attribute binary compatibility with Java SDK, so this release is compatible with Java SDKs 3.1.5 to 3.2.0.


== Distributed Transactions Java 1.1.8 (26 May 2021)

This release has been tested with Couchbase Java SDK version 3.1.5 and requires exactly that version (higher versions of the Java SDK are not compatible).

https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-transactions-java-1.1.8/[JavaDocs]

=== Improvements
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-339[TXNJ-339],
https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-370[TXNJ-370],
https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-388[TXNJ-388],
https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-400[TXNJ-400],
https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-404[TXNJ-404]:
Continuing improvements to the beta-level support for Query.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-399[TXNJ-399]:
Include the version of the transactions library in the logging.

=== Bug Fixes
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-347[TXNJ-347]:
Solves a potential rare data race issue where a transaction that expires immediately after beginning the commit phase, 
which could in theory have its staged changes overwritten by another transaction.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-413[TXNJ-413]:
After `Transactions::close` was called, cleanup threads could continue to be created.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-382[TXNJ-382],
https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-402[TXNJ-402]:
If the cleanup window was set to an aggressive value (less than 10 seconds), then cleanup could both happen more quickly than the configured cleanup window and. in some cases, skip some ATRs due to backpressure.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-405[TXNJ-405]:
If T2 is blocked writing to a document because it is involved in T1, but T1's ATR has been deleted, then permit T2 to continue.

== Distributed Transactions Java 1.1.7 (27 April 2021)

This release has been tested with Couchbase Java SDK version 3.1.4 and requires that version as a minimum.

WARNING: Due to protocol level changes, Java SDK 3.1.4 and later are not compatible with _pre-release_ versions of Couchbase Server 7.0.
By extension, Distributed Transactions Java 1.1.7 and later are also not compatible.

https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-transactions-java-1.1.7/[JavaDocs]

=== Improvements

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-248[TXNJ-248],
https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-372[TXNJ-372],
https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-355[TXNJ-355]:
Logging improvements and fixes.

=== Bug Fixes

Very short cleanup window times are now handled correctly.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-379[TXNJ-379]:
Improved efficiency of lost cleanup thread pool.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-385[TXNJ-385]:
Fixed `OpenTelemetry` spans for cleanup.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-391[TXNJ-391]:
Deferred transactions are no longer placed on cleanup queue.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-396[TXNJ-396]:
The SDK's configured `JsonSerializer` and `Transcoder` are no longer used for any internal JSON operations.


== Distributed Transactions Java 1.1.6 (22 March 2021)

This release has been tested with Couchbase Java SDK version 3.1.3 and requires version 3.1.0 at a minimum.

https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-transactions-java-1.1.6/[JavaDocs]

=== New Features
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-262[TXNJ-262]:
Support for OpenTelemetry and OpenTracing, at Developer Preview level, providing transparency and visibility of both transactional operation and performance.
See the xref:howtos:distributed-acid-transactions-from-the-sdk.adoc#tracing[documentation] for further details.

=== Performance
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-375[TXNJ-375]:
Reducing the amount of metadata writes required for each transaction attempt, from four to three.
This should give a significant improvement in performance, particularly in latency on smaller transactions, and throughput generally.

=== Improvements
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-358[TXNJ-358]:
Allow all valid combinations of multiple serial Key-Value operations on the same document.

=== Forward Compatibility
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-363[TXNJ-362]:
Future-proofing the protocol to handle currently unknown transaction states.

== Distributed Transactions Java 1.1.5 (22 February 2021)

This release of Couchbase Distributed ACID Transactions for Java further refines the beta-level support for N1QL queries in transactions, the server side component of which is added in Couchbase Server 7.0.0 (currently in beta), and fixes several important bugs.
All users are recommended to upgrade.

Users of this functionality should note that the second beta release of Couchbase Server 7.0.0 (not yet released at time of writing) is not fully compatible with the previous 1.1.3 and 1.1.4 versions of the library.
This 1.1.5 release is compatible with both server releases.

This release has been tested with Couchbase Java SDK version 3.1.2 and requires version 3.1.0 at a minimum.
It is recommended that you declare a dependency on this transactions release and allow your build management tool to pull in the correct transitive dependencies, including the Couchbase Java SDK.

https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-transactions-java-1.1.5/[JavaDocs]

=== Bug Fixes

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-275[TXNJ-275],
https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-371[TXNJ-371],
https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-373[TXNJ-373]:
The Java SDK's configured JsonSerializer is no longer used for internal JSON serialization tasks.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-301[TXNJ-301]:
Previously cleanup of 'lost' transactions was only happening on buckets that the application had opened.
Now, it will happen on all buckets in the cluster, as intended.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-345[TXNJ-345]:
Transaction B is allowed to overwrite staged changes from Transaction A in some situations.
B was previously allowed to insert a document over a staged replace or remove from A, this has now been patched: B should not be able to insert a doc that already exists.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-356[TXNJ-356]:
Fixed ambiguity resolution handling during ATR commit.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-351[TXNJ-351]:
Lost transactions involves polling of ATR documents, and this is now correctly rate-limited so that the time taken for a cleanup run should be much closer to the configured cleanup window.

=== Improvements

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-353[TXNJ-353]:
Documents with staged data may now have that data overwritten if their Active Transaction Records (ATRs) have been deleted, providing some protection against accidental user modification of the ATRs.
(A reminder that ATRs should not be modified by the user, they are managed automatically by the transactions libraries.)
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-313[TXNJ-313], 
https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-334[TXNJ-334],
https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-354[TXNJ-354]:
Further refinements for query support.
This support remains at beta-level while Couchbase Server 7.0 is in beta.


== Distributed Transactions Java 1.1.4 (21 December 2020)

This release of Couchbase Distributed ACID Transactions for Java further refines the beta-level support for N1QL queries in transactions, the server side component of which is added in Couchbase Server 7.0.0 (currently in beta).

It has been tested with, and requires, Couchbase Java SDK version 3.1.0.
It is recommended that you declare a dependency on this transactions release and allow your build management tool to pull in the correct transitive dependencies, including the Couchbase Java SDK.

https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-transactions-java-1.1.4/[JavaDocs]

=== Improved N1QL Query Support
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-304[TXNJ-304]:
Expose parameters for all TransactionQueryOptions.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-306[TXNJ-306]:
Fix reactive query streaming.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-298[TXNJ-298]:
Refactor sending to same query node into Java SDK.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-303[TXNJ-303]:
Refactor handling of query's transaction queue being full into SDK.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-311[TXNJ-311]:
Fail deferred transactions in query mode.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-314[TXNJ-314]:
Add expiry and done checks in all query stages.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-316[TXNJ-316]:
Fail gracefully if query used on a pre-7.0 node.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-321[TXNJ-321]:
Query in next beta release will return more detailed errors, handle them
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-323[TXNJ-323]:
Timeout on COMMIT should raise TransactionCommitAmbiguous.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-324[TXNJ-324]:
Do not issue a query if the transaction is about to expire.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-328[TXNJ-328]:
Fatal query errors should cause immediate rollback.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-329[TXNJ-329]:
getOptional of non-existent doc should not fail transaction.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-330[TXNJ-330]:
Insert of existing doc should raise ignorable DocExistsException.

=== Improvements
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-309[TXNJ-309]:
Transaction operations issued after a rollback/commit are now rejected.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-327[TXNJ-327]:
Remove dependency on Flux.retryWhen, to provide compatibility with Java client 3.1.0.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-264[TXNJ-264]:
The durability level used for the transaction is now stored with the transaction's metadata.
This means that compatible cleanup clients can use the same durability level to cleanup the transaction.

=== Bug Fixes
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-335[TXNJ-335]:
Fetching a document's ATR entry now correctly uses that ATR's collection.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-337[TXNJ-337]:
Consistently applied log redaction.

=== API Affecting
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-318[TXNJ-318]:
TransactionResult::attempts() is now deprecated and should no longer be used, as this information is not available if queries are used inside a transaction.

== Distributed Transactions Java 1.1.3 (17 November 2020)

This release of Couchbase Distributed ACID Transactions for Java supports the beta release of Couchbase Server 7.0 with support for two big new features: N1QL queries, and custom metadata collections.

https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-transactions-java-1.1.3/[JavaDocs]

=== N1QL Queries
With Couchbase Server 7.0 beta and this 1.1.3 release, comes support for using N1QL queries inside the transaction lambda:

[source,java]
----
include::example$Transactions.java[tag=query-basic,indent=0]
----

See the xref:howtos:distributed-acid-transactions-from-the-sdk.adoc#n1ql-queries[documentation] for further details.

NOTE: Support for queries in 1.1.3 is at beta level and is marked as @Stability.Volatile, which means the API may need to change as we gather feedback during the Couchbase Server 7.0 beta period.
The feature should not be used in any production deployment while it is at beta level.
Please take this opportunity to provide feedback on this feature, via either support or our forums.

=== Custom Metadata Collections
Transactions create and use metadata documents, that are created in the bucket of the first mutated document in the transaction.

With Couchbase Server 7.0 beta comes support for scopes and collections, providing a more granular way of organising documents.

You can now, completely optionally, use a collection to store the metadata documents, using a new configuration parameter:

[source,java]
----
include::example$Transactions.java[tag=custom-metadata,indent=0]
----

See the xref:howtos:distributed-acid-transactions-from-the-sdk.adoc#custom-metadata-collections[documentation] for further details.

NOTE: Support for custom metadata collections in 1.1.3 is at beta level and is marked as @Stability.Volatile, which means the API may need to change as we gather feedback during the Couchbase Server 7.0 beta period.
The feature should not be used in any production deployment while it is at beta level.
Please take this opportunity to provide feedback on this feature, via either support or our forums.

=== New Features
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-302[TXNJ-302]:
Initial beta-level support for queries inside transactions.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-280[TXNJ-280]:
Initial beta-level support for custom metadata collections.

=== Improvements
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-290[TXNJ-290]:
Transaction metadata documents now have binary bodies (rather than empty JSON) to improve compatibility with query.

== Distributed Transactions Java 1.1.2 (20 October 2020)

This release of Couchbase Distributed ACID Transactions for Java includes multiple bug-fixes and improvements.

// https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-transactions-java-1.1.2/[JavaDocs]

=== Bug Fixes

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-270[TXNJ-270]:
Cleanup of a doc is always using the default collection.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-271[TXNJ-271]:
Cleanup should continue as success if it finds the ATR entry has been removed.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-276[TXNJ-276]:
Trying to remove clients from client record will overflow the sub-doc 16 limit.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-282[TXNJ-282]:
ATR ids should be redacted in logs.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-283[TXNJ-283]:
ATRs are using the collection of the first mutated document, rather than the default collection of that document's bucket.

=== Performance Improvements

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-269[TXNJ-269]:
Cleanup does not need to fetch the ATR.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-272[TXNJ-272]:
Cleanup unnecessarily fetches the document body.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-273[TXNJ-273]:
MAV reads do not need to fetch the ATR, they only need to fetch an entry.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-274[TXNJ-274]:
Client record can use $vbucket.HLC rather than performing a dummy update.

=== Other Improvements

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-278[TXNJ-278]:
Increase client record safety margin from 2 to 20 seconds.


== Distributed Transactions Java 1.1.1 (2 October 2020)

This is the fourth release of Couchbase Distributed ACID Transactions for Java.
It includes 2 bug-fixes.

// https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-transactions-java-1.1.1/[JavaDocs]

=== Bug Fixes

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-261[TXNJ-261]:
The PerTransactionConfig durability setting was not being used.
It should now be passed through from the builder to the build.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-259[TXNJ-259]:
In the very unlikely case of eternally repeated errors while setting ATR to ROLLED_BACK, the logic would repeat indefinitely and not check transaction expiry.
The logic has been tweaked to ensure that this cannot happen. 

== Distributed Transactions Java 1.1.0 (12 August 2020)
This is the third release of Couchbase Distributed ACID Transactions for Java.
It includes 24 bug-fixes and improvements (some internal improvements are not listed below).

It is built on Couchbase java-client version 3.0.7, and requires Couchbase Server 6.6 or above.
Note this is a change from the previous requirement for Couchbase Server 6.5.

https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-transactions-java-1.1.0/[JavaDocs]

=== Upgrading
IMPORTANT: All existing users are _strongly_ recommended to read this section.

Couchbase Server 6.6 adds crucial functionality for transactions.
This functionality is so important to our isolation guarantees that we are making Couchbase Server 6.6 the new minimum supported version for Couchbase transactions, as of this release.

In general we work hard to ensure that Couchbase software, including transactions, works seamlessly across all currently supported Couchbase Server releases, and that transactional releases are fully interopable with each other.
For technical reasons, we were unable to achieve that goal for this release, and there are two compatibility rules that the user must understand in order to safely upgrade.

These are the two compatibility rules:

* This release requires Couchbase Server 6.6, it cannot run on 6.5.
** Transactions that try to perform an insert will fail with `TransactionFailed`.
* Previous releases are not fully forward-compatible with this release.  This release must not be run concurrently with a previous release.
** In fact, the previous release must not be run at all, after this release has been run once.

The suggested upgrade path is:

* Upgrade the cluster fully from Couchbase Server 6.5 to 6.6.  
This can be a live or offline upgrade.
* Fully bring down the application running the previous release.  
Make sure no such application instances are running.
* Bring up the application running the new release.
* Make sure to never bring up an application running the previous release.

We have added forwards-compatibility features to the transactions protocol and software, with the intent that in the future, upgrading will be as seamless and simple as you expect from Couchbase.

=== Headline Improvements
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-125[TXNJ-125]: 
Our transactions stages changes to a document alongside that document.
In previous releases and Couchbase Server 6.5, this required creating an empty document to store inserts.
Whilst these were not visible pre-commit to many parts of the Couchbase Data Platform, they were visible in some places -- including the UI.
Couchbase Server 6.6 brings new functionality that allows these inserts to be fully committed, providing full Read Committed isolation for all mutations.

=== Write-Write Conflict Improvements
When a transaction (T1) tries to mutate a document that's in another transaction (T2), this is a write-write conflict.

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-246[TXNJ-246]: 
Write-write conflict has been tuned to backoff-and-retry much less aggressively, which will result in much less 'churn' and overhead.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-86[TXNJ-86]: 
T1 previously had to backoff and retry until either T2 completed, or cleanup discovered it (with default settings, that can take up to a minute).
Now, T1 can proceed to overwrite the document if it finds T2 has expired or completed.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-217[TXNJ-217]: 
Performance improvement -- T1 now only fetches the T2-specific data from T2's Active Transaction Record (ATR), rather than the full document.

=== Cleanup Improvements
Creating the `Transactions` object creates a background thread performing cleanup, which scans for expired transactions created by any application on any bucket.

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-208[TXNJ-208]: 
If cleanup is still unable to cleanup a transaction after two hours, it will begin logging that failure at WARN level.
If there is not a reasonable explanation for cleanup continuing to fail (such as a downed node that has not been failed-over), then users are encouraged to send these logs to Couchbase support.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-13[TXNJ-13]: 
Performance improvement -- cleanup has been tuned to remove unnecessary writes.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-108[TXNJ-108]: 
Cancel cleanup if a pending transaction is discovered to now be committed.
This should not occur, and is simply a safety-check.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-229[TXNJ-229]: 
Cleanup already checked that documents are in the expected state before cleaning them up, and now also uses CAS to verify that this is still the case when it gets to the cleanup point.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-240[TXNJ-240]: 
Cleanup of documents is now done with durable writes.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-232[TXNJ-232]: 
The expiry field inside an attempt now reflects time elapsed inside the transaction.

=== API Impacting
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-227[TXNJ-227]: 
A runtime check is now performed to ensure the minimum required java-client version is used.
This will cause the application to fast-fail at the point of creating the `Transactions` object, rather than failing with a less clear error when creating transactions.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-219[TXNJ-219]: 
The `TransactionConfigBuilder` documentation stated that underlying Key-Value reads and writes would use kvTimeout and kvDurableTimeout from the configured environment if one is not specified.
That was not being done, and now is.

=== Bug Fixes
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-237[TXNJ-237]: 
A Scala bug with Class.getSimpleName meant the library could not be called from Scala.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-250[TXNJ-250]: 
MAV reads should return post-transaction content on COMPLETED, not just COMMITTED.

=== Reliability Improvements
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-249[TXNJ-249]: 
The documentation advises applications to not catch exceptions inside the lambda (and if they have to, to propagate them).
This advice remains, but if it is not followed, now subsequent operations (including commit) will fail.
This means we no longer rely on the application propagating errors to ensure that transactions work correctly.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-231[TXNJ-231]: 
Rollback previously assumed that documents had not changed between them being staged and rolled back.
That should be the case, but now CAS is used to confirm it.


== Distributed Transactions Java 1.0.1 (19 June 2020)

This is the second release of Couchbase Distributed ACID Transactions.

It is built on Couchbase java-client version 3.0.5, and requires Couchbase Server 6.5 or above.

It is strongly recommended that all users read the "API Changes" section, as they may desire to make application changes in order to use this newly exposed information.

https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-transactions-java-1.0.1/[JavaDocs]

=== API Changes

==== TransactionCommitAmbiguous
*Summary:* A TransactionCommitAmbiguous exception has been added, and applications may wish to handle it (https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-205[TXNJ-205]).

Ambiguity is inevitable in any system, especially a distributed one.

Each transaction has a 'single point of truth' that is updated atomically to reflect whether it is committed.

However, it is not always possible for the protocol to become 100% certain that the operation was successful, before the transaction expires.
This is important as the transaction may or may not have successfully committed, and in the previous release this was not reported to the application.

The library will now raise a new error, TransactionCommitAmbiguous, to indicate this state.
TransactionCommitAmbiguous derives from the existing TransactionFailed that applications will already be handling.

On TransactionCommitAmbiguous, the transaction may or may not have reached the commit point.
If it has reached it, then the transaction will be fully completed ("unstaged") by the asynchronous cleanup process at some point in the future.
With default settings this will usually be within a minute, but whatever underlying fault has caused the TransactionCommitAmbiguous may lead to it taking longer.

*Handling:* This error can be challenging for an application to handle.
One simple approach is to retry the transaction at some point in the future.
Alternatively, if transaction completion time is not a priority, then transaction expiration times can be extended across the board through `TransactionConfigBuilder`.
This will allow the protocol more time to resolve the ambiguity, if possible.

==== TransactionResult.unstagingComplete()
*Summary:* Failures during the post-commit unstaging phase can now result in the transaction successfully returning.  A new `TransactionResult.unstagingComplete()` method has been added (https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-209[TXNJ-209]).

As above, there is a 'single point of truth' for a transaction.
After this atomic commit point is reached, the documents themselves still need to be committed (we also call this "unstaging").
However, transactionally-aware actors will now be returning the post-transaction versions of the documents, and the transaction is effectively fully committed to those actors.

So if the application is solely working with transaction-aware actors, then the unstaging process is optional.
The previous release would retry any failures during the unstaging process until the transaction expires, but this unnecessarily penalises applications that do not require unstaging to be completed.

So, many errors during unstaging will now cause the transaction to immediately return success.
The asynchronous cleanup process will still complete the unstaging process at a later point.

A new `unstagingComplete()` call is added to `TransactionResult` to indicate whether the unstaging process completed successfully or not.
This should be used any time that the application needs all results of the transaction to be immediately available to non-transactional actors (which currently includes N1QL and non-transactional Key-Value reads).

Putting two API changes above together, the recommendation for error handling of a typical transaction is now this:

[source,java]
----
include::example$Transactions.java[tag=imports,indent=0]
----

[source,java]
----
include::example$Transactions.java[tag=demo_1_0_1,indent=0]
----

=== Bug Fixes and Stability
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-184[TXNJ-184]:
If doc is found to be removed while committing it, create it.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-187[TXNJ-187]:
Errors raised while setting ATR state to Committed are now regarded as pre-commit errors, e.g. they can cause the transaction to fail or retry.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-188[TXNJ-188], https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-192[TXNJ-192]:
The TransactionResult.attempts() field now always correctly reflects all attempts made.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-196[TXNJ-196]:
Pre-commit expiry now always triggers rollback.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-197[TXNJ-197]:
Expiry during app-rollback now enters expiry-overtime-mode and has one more attempt at completing rollback.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-202[TXNJ-202], https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-200[TXNJ-200]:
FAIL_ATR_FULL now handled consistently throughout protocol.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-210[TXNJ-210]:
If anything goes wrong during app-rollback, return success. 
Rollback will be completed by the asynchronous cleanup process, and unrolled-back metadata is handled by the protocol anyway.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-211[TXNJ-211]:
If rollback fails, the original error that caused the rollback is the one raised as the `getCause()` of any final exception raised to the application.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-218[TXNJ-218]:
Inserting the same document in the same transaction is now caught as an application bug, and will fail the transaction.

=== Improvements
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-189[TXNJ-189]:
Adds a transactionId field throughout the metadata, to assist with debugging.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-190[TXNJ-190]:
Write elided stacktraces in the logs to improve readability.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-191[TXNJ-191], https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-199[TXNJ-199]:
Performance improvement so that transactions are only rolled back and/or cleaned up if they reached the point of creating an ATR entry (e.g. if there is anything to cleanup).
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-204[TXNJ-204]:
All context methods, such as ctx.insert and ctx.replace, will now consistently only raise `ErrorWrapper` exceptions. 
Applications should not be catching any exceptions from these methods so this is not expected to be impacting.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-215[TXNJ-215]:
Adjust exponential backoff retry parameter from 250msecs down to 100msecs.

== Distributed Transactions Java 1.0.0 (17 January 2020)
This is the first General Availability (GA) release of Distributed ACID Transactions 1.0.0 for Couchbase Server 6.5.

Built on Couchbase java-client version 3.0.0 (GA).
Requires Couchbase Server 6.5 or above.

=== Bug Fixes & Stability
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-119[TXNJ-119]:
Calling commit multiple times leads to an error mentioning "rollback"; changed to separate error messages for commit and rollback.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-126[TXNJ-126]:
Expire a transaction immediately if it expires while deferred.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-149[TXNJ-149]:
Improve ambiguous error handling during commit.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-163[TXNJ-163], https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-156[TXNJ-156]:
Ensure that java-client errors are correctly handled after its changes to error handling.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-165[TXNJ-165]:
Fix reactor.core.Exceptions$OverflowException seen during cleanup.  Would only affect users setting a cleanup window of 1 second or less.

=== Enhancements
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-173[TXNJ-173]:
Register for changes to bucket configurations, so if the application opens a bucket after creating Transactions object, background cleanup will be started on those new buckets.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-69[TXNJ-69]:
Provide some future proofing for client-record.  Implementation detail, allows for future extensibility of the background cleanup process.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-111[TXNJ-111], https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-110[TXNJ-110]:
Sends new events to the java-client event-bus with details from the background cleanup process.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-120[TXNJ-120]:
Once Transactions object is closed, prevent futher operations on it as a sanity check.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-151[TXNJ-151]:
Add Java client metadata to help track failures.  Implementation detail, adds some additional info to exceptions to help debugging.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-152[TXNJ-152]:
When transaction expires, attempt to roll it back (or complete commit). 
Completes the work in TXNJ-124 (in 1.0.0-beta.3), to cover all cases.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-155[TXNJ-155]:
Remove OpenTracing dependency.  An implementation detail as it has already been removed from the API, this completes the work and removes the dependency on the jar. 
Once OpenTelemetry (OpenTracing's direct replacement) is stable, support for it will be added.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-162[TXNJ-162]:
Performance improvements related to String parsing.  Internal benchmarking sees a huge reduction in memory allocations and GC pressure with this change.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-167[TXNJ-167]:
Rebuild on java-client 3.0.0 GA.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-170[TXNJ-170]:
Perform ATR cleanup in serial, which prevents errors being sent to Hooks.onErrorDropped (and by default stdout) when shutting down transactions. 
Along with java-client fix https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JVMCBC-781[JVMCBC-781], users should no longer see Hooks.onErrorDropped errors.

=== API changes
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-171[TXNJ-171]:
Rename MAJORITY_AND_PERSIST_ON_MASTER to MAJORITY_AND_PERSIST_ON_ACTIVE, in accordance with new naming conventions.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-169[TXNJ-169]:
Simplify cleanup window logic to remove divide-by-2; previously, specifying `TransactionConfigBuilder.cleanupWindow(120 seconds)` would lead to ATRs getting checked every 60 seconds (in the general case): now to reduce confusion they will be checked every 120 seconds.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-164[TXNJ-164]:
Remove `TransactionConfigBuilder.logDirectlyCleanup`.  As all cleanup trace is now sent directly to java-client's event-bus, it can be configured from there and this parameter is useless.

== Distributed Transactions Java 1.0.0-beta.3 (13th November 2019)

This is the third _Beta_ release of Distributed ACID Transactions 1.0.0 for Couchbase Server 6.5 and the Java 3.0.0 client.
There are no major changes.
The main purpose of the release is to rebuild on top of the beta.1 release of the java-client, so applications can use both together.

Built on Couchbase java-client version 3.0.0-beta.1.
Requires Couchbase Server 6.5 or above.

=== Bug-fixes And Stability
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-127[TXNJ-127]:
Fixes an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` error when using the reactive API to perform concurrency inside a txn.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-145[TXNJ-145]:
ATR names are changed, to hash to their expected vbucket.
It is recommended to flush (remove all documents from) the bucket to remove ATR documents from previous releases.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-136[TXNJ-136]:
Fixes an erroneous `IllegalDocumentState` alert in edge-cases involving the `DurabilityAmbiguous` error.

=== New Features and Enhancements
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-124[TXNJ-124]:
An aborting transaction will now attempt rollback before completing raising `TransactionExpired` failure, rather than leaving cleanup solely to cleanup process.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-131[TXNJ-131]:
Minor logging improvement.

== Distributed Transactions Java 1.0.0-beta.2 (9th September 2019)

This is the second _Beta_ release of Distributed ACID Transactions 1.0.0 for Couchbase Server 6.5 and the Java 3.0.0 client.

Built on Couchbase java-client version 3.0.0-alpha.7.
Requires Couchbase Server 6.5 beta or above.

=== Bug-fixes and stability
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JVMCBC-728[JVMCBC-728]: This fix in the underlying Couchbase java-client prevented conflict detection from working correctly in all situations with durability enabled (which it is, by default).
All users are strongly recommended to upgrade as soon as possible, for this fix.

=== Breaking changes
As a rule, we do not make breaking API changes after GA release, and only consider them rarely during the beta period.
This particular breaking change aligns the transaction and Java libraries much better, makes for a more natural and usable API, and requires little porting work.

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-121[TXNJ-121]: Align with the Couchbase Java client,
by renaming the `get` method to `getOptional`, `getOrError` to `get`, and `TransactionJsonDocument` to `TransactionGetResult`.

=== Performance

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-40[TXNJ-40]:
Retry operations on many transient errors, rather than retrying the full transaction.

=== New features

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-85[TXNJ-85]:
(Experimental) Supported deferred commit for transactions.
Please see the documentation for details.
This feature should be regarded as alpha, as its API and functionality may change in the future; please feel free to try it out and provide feedback.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-112[TXNJ-112]:
(Experimental) Allow the number of ATRs to be configured.
This can potentially be used to improve transactions throughput, but is currently experimental and should be used only with Couchbase's guidance.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-107[TXNJ-107]: Make txn metadata documents more consistently named by prefacing them with "_txn:"

== Distributed Transactions Java 1.0.0-beta.1

This is the first _Beta_ release of Distributed ACID Transactions 1.0.0 for Couchbase Server 6.5 and the Java 3.0.0 client.
