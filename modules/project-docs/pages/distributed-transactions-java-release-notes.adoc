= Couchbase Distributed ACID Transactions for Java SDK Release Notes
:navtitle: Transactions Release Notes
:page-topic-type: project-doc
:page-aliases: transactions-release-notes

Couchbase Distributed ACID Transactions is distributed as a separate library for the Java SDK.
This page features the release notes for that library -- for release notes, download links, and installation methods for the latest 3.x Java SDK releases, see xref:sdk-release-notes.adoc[the current Release Notes page].

== Using Distributed Transactions

See the xref:6.5@server:learn:data/transactions.adoc[Distributed ACID Transactions concept doc] in the server documentation for details of how Couchbase implements transactions.
The xref:howtos:distributed-acid-transactions-from-the-sdk.adoc[Distributed Transactions HOWTO doc] walks you through all aspects of working with Distributed Transactions.

== Distributed Transactions Java 1.0.1 (19 June 2020)
This is the second release of Couchbase Distributed ACID Transactions.

It is built on Couchbase java-client version 3.0.5, and requires Couchbase Server 6.5 or above.

It is strongly recommended that all users read the "API Changes" section, as they may desire to make application changes in order to use this newly exposed information.

https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-transactions-java-1.0.1/[JavaDocs]

=== API Changes

==== TransactionCommitAmbiguous
*Summary:* A TransactionCommitAmbiguous exception has been added, and applications may wish to handle it (https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-205[TXNJ-205]).

Ambiguity is inevitable in any system, especially a distributed one.

Each transaction has a 'single point of truth' that is updated atomically to reflect whether it is committed.

However, it is not always possible for the protocol to become 100% certain that the operation was successful, before the transaction expires.
This is important as the transaction may or may not have successfully committed, and in the previous release this was not reported to the application.

The library will now raise a new error, TransactionCommitAmbiguous, to indicate this state.
TransactionCommitAmbiguous derives from the existing TransactionFailed that applications will already be handling.

On TransactionCommitAmbiguous, the transaction may or may not have reached the commit point.
If it has reached it, then the transaction will be fully completed ("unstaged") by the asynchronous cleanup process at some point in the future.
With default settings this will usually be within a minute, but whatever underlying fault has caused the TransactionCommitAmbiguous may lead to it taking longer.

*Handling:* This error can be challenging for an application to handle.
One simple approach is to retry the transaction at some point in the future.
Alternatively, if transaction completion time is not a priority, then transaction expiration times can be extended across the board through `TransactionConfigBuilder`.
This will allow the protocol more time to resolve the ambiguity, if possible.

==== TransactionResult.unstagingComplete()
*Summary:* Failures during the post-commit unstaging phase can now result in the transaction successfully returning.  A new `TransactionResult.unstagingComplete()` method has been added (https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-209[TXNJ-209]).

As above, there is a 'single point of truth' for a transaction.
After this atomic commit point is reached, the documents themselves still need to be committed (we also call this "unstaging").
However, transactionally-aware actors will now be returning the post-transaction versions of the documents, and the transaction is effectively fully committed to those actors.

So if the application is solely working with transaction-aware actors, then the unstaging process is optional.
The previous release would retry any failures during the unstaging process until the transaction expires, but this unnecessarily penalises applications that do not require unstaging to be completed.

So, many errors during unstaging will now cause the transaction to immediately return success.
The asynchronous cleanup process will still complete the unstaging process at a later point.

A new `unstagingComplete()` call is added to `TransactionResult` to indicate whether the unstaging process completed successfully or not.
This should be used any time that the application needs all results of the transaction to be immediately available to non-transactional actors (which currently includes N1QL and non-transactional Key-Value reads).

Putting two API changes above together, the recommendation for error handling of a typical transaction is now this:

=== Bug Fixes and Stability
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-184[TXNJ-184]:
If doc is found to be removed while committing it, create it.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-187[TXNJ-187]:
Errors raised while setting ATR state to Committed are now regarded as pre-commit errors, e.g. they can cause the transaction to fail or retry.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-188[TXNJ-188], https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-192[TXNJ-192]:
The TransactionResult.attempts() field now always correctly reflects all attempts made.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-196[TXNJ-196]:
Pre-commit expiry now always triggers rollback.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-197[TXNJ-197]:
Expiry during app-rollback now enters expiry-overtime-mode and has one more attempt at completing rollback.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-202[TXNJ-202], https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-200[TXNJ-200]:
FAIL_ATR_FULL now handled consistently throughout protocol.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-210[TXNJ-210]:
If anything goes wrong during app-rollback, return success. 
Rollback will be completed by the asynchronous cleanup process, and unrolled-back metadata is handled by the protocol anyway.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-211[TXNJ-211]:
If rollback fails, the original error that caused the rollback is the one raised as the `getCause()` of any final exception raised to the application.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-218[TXNJ-218]:
Inserting the same document in the same transaction is now caught as an application bug, and will fail the transaction.

=== Improvements
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-189[TXNJ-189]:
Adds a transactionId field throughout the metadata, to assist with debugging.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-190[TXNJ-190]:
Write elided stacktraces in the logs to improve readability.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-191[TXNJ-191], https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-199[TXNJ-199]:
Performance improvement so that transactions are only rolled back and/or cleaned up if they reached the point of creating an ATR entry (e.g. if there is anything to cleanup).
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-204[TXNJ-204]:
All context methods, such as ctx.insert and ctx.replace, will now consistently only raise `ErrorWrapper` exceptions. 
Applications should not be catching any exceptions from these methods so this is not expected to be impacting.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-215[TXNJ-215]:
Adjust exponential backoff retry parameter from 250msecs down to 100msecs.

== Distributed Transactions Java 1.0.0 (17 January 2020)
This is the first General Availability (GA) release of Distributed ACID Transactions 1.0.0 for Couchbase Server 6.5.

Built on Couchbase java-client version 3.0.0 (GA).
Requires Couchbase Server 6.5 or above.

=== Bug Fixes & Stability
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-119[TXNJ-119]:
Calling commit multiple times leads to an error mentioning "rollback"; changed to separate error messages for commit and rollback.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-126[TXNJ-126]:
Expire a transaction immediately if it expires while deferred.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-149[TXNJ-149]:
Improve ambiguous error handling during commit.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-163[TXNJ-163], https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-156[TXNJ-156]:
Ensure that java-client errors are correctly handled after its changes to error handling.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-165[TXNJ-165]:
Fix reactor.core.Exceptions$OverflowException seen during cleanup.  Would only affect users setting a cleanup window of 1 second or less.

=== Enhancements
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-173[TXNJ-173]:
Register for changes to bucket configurations, so if the application opens a bucket after creating Transactions object, background cleanup will be started on those new buckets.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-69[TXNJ-69]:
Provide some future proofing for client-record.  Implementation detail, allows for future extensibility of the background cleanup process.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-111[TXNJ-111], https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-110[TXNJ-110]:
Sends new events to the java-client event-bus with details from the background cleanup process.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-120[TXNJ-120]:
Once Transactions object is closed, prevent futher operations on it as a sanity check.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-151[TXNJ-151]:
Add Java client metadata to help track failures.  Implementation detail, adds some additional info to exceptions to help debugging.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-152[TXNJ-152]:
When transaction expires, attempt to roll it back (or complete commit). 
Completes the work in TXNJ-124 (in 1.0.0-beta.3), to cover all cases.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-155[TXNJ-155]:
Remove OpenTracing dependency.  An implementation detail as it has already been removed from the API, this completes the work and removes the dependency on the jar. 
Once OpenTelemetry (OpenTracing's direct replacement) is stable, support for it will be added.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-162[TXNJ-162]:
Performance improvements related to String parsing.  Internal benchmarking sees a huge reduction in memory allocations and GC pressure with this change.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-167[TXNJ-167]:
Rebuild on java-client 3.0.0 GA.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-170[TXNJ-170]:
Perform ATR cleanup in serial, which prevents errors being sent to Hooks.onErrorDropped (and by default stdout) when shutting down transactions. 
Along with java-client fix https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JVMCBC-781[JVMCBC-781], users should no longer see Hooks.onErrorDropped errors.

=== API changes
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-171[TXNJ-171]:
Rename MAJORITY_AND_PERSIST_ON_MASTER to MAJORITY_AND_PERSIST_ON_ACTIVE, in accordance with new naming conventions.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-169[TXNJ-169]:
Simplify cleanup window logic to remove divide-by-2; previously, specifying `TransactionConfigBuilder.cleanupWindow(120 seconds)` would lead to ATRs getting checked every 60 seconds (in the general case): now to reduce confusion they will be checked every 120 seconds.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-164[TXNJ-164]:
Remove `TransactionConfigBuilder.logDirectlyCleanup`.  As all cleanup trace is now sent directly to java-client's event-bus, it can be configured from there and this parameter is useless.

== Distributed Transactions Java 1.0.0-beta.3 (13th November 2019)

This is the third _Beta_ release of Distributed ACID Transactions 1.0.0 for Couchbase Server 6.5 and the Java 3.0.0 client.
There are no major changes.
The main purpose of the release is to rebuild on top of the beta.1 release of the java-client, so applications can use both together.

Built on Couchbase java-client version 3.0.0-beta.1.
Requires Couchbase Server 6.5 or above.

=== Bug-fixes And Stability
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-127[TXNJ-127]:
Fixes an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` error when using the reactive API to perform concurrency inside a txn.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-145[TXNJ-145]:
ATR names are changed, to hash to their expected vbucket.
It is recommended to flush (remove all documents from) the bucket to remove ATR documents from previous releases.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-136[TXNJ-136]:
Fixes an erroneous `IllegalDocumentState` alert in edge-cases involving the `DurabilityAmbiguous` error.

=== New Features and Enhancements
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-124[TXNJ-124]:
An aborting transaction will now attempt rollback before completing raising `TransactionExpired` failure, rather than leaving cleanup solely to cleanup process.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-131[TXNJ-131]:
Minor logging improvement.

== Distributed Transactions Java 1.0.0-beta.2 (9th September 2019)

This is the second _Beta_ release of Distributed ACID Transactions 1.0.0 for Couchbase Server 6.5 and the Java 3.0.0 client.

Built on Couchbase java-client version 3.0.0-alpha.7.
Requires Couchbase Server 6.5 beta or above.

=== Bug-fixes and stability
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JVMCBC-728[JVMCBC-728]: This fix in the underlying Couchbase java-client prevented conflict detection from working correctly in all situations with durability enabled (which it is, by default).
All users are strongly recommended to upgrade as soon as possible, for this fix.

=== Breaking changes
As a rule, we do not make breaking API changes after GA release, and only consider them rarely during the beta period.
This particular breaking change aligns the transaction and Java libraries much better, makes for a more natural and usable API, and requires little porting work.

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-121[TXNJ-121]: Align with the Couchbase Java client,
by renaming the `get` method to `getOptional`, `getOrError` to `get`, and `TransactionJsonDocument` to `TransactionGetResult`.

=== Performance

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-40[TXNJ-40]:
Retry operations on many transient errors, rather than retrying the full transaction.

=== New features

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-85[TXNJ-85]:
(Experimental) Supported deferred commit for transactions.
Please see the documentation for details.
This feature should be regarded as alpha, as its API and functionality may change in the future; please feel free to try it out and provide feedback.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-112[TXNJ-112]:
(Experimental) Allow the number of ATRs to be configured.
This can potentially be used to improve transactions throughput, but is currently experimental and should be used only with Couchbase's guidance.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/TXNJ-107[TXNJ-107]: Make txn metadata documents more consistently named by prefacing them with "_txn:"

== Distributed Transactions Java 1.0.0-beta.1

This is the first _Beta_ release of Distributed ACID Transactions 1.0.0 for Couchbase Server 6.5 and the Java 3.0.0 client.
