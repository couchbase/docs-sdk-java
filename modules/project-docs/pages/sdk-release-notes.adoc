== Installation

// tag::jdk-version[]
At least Java 8 is required for current releases;
see the xref:project-docs:compatibility.adoc#jdk-compat[Compatibility] section for details.
We recommend running the latest LTS version (i.e. at the time of writing JDK 11) with the highest patch version available.
Java 11 has various enhancements like lambda local variable type inference, profiling tools, and updated security features.

== Version 3.0.7 (4 August 2020)

Version 3.0.7 is the eighth release of the 3.0 series, bringing enhancements and bugfixes over the last stable release.

http://packages.couchbase.com/clients/java/3.0.7/Couchbase-Java-Client-3.0.7.zip[Download] |
https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-java-client-3.0.7/index.html[API Reference] |
http://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-core-io-2.0.8/[Core API Reference]

The supported and tested dependencies for this release are:

* com.couchbase.client:**java-client:3.0.7**
* com.couchbase.client:**core-io:2.0.8**
* io.projectreactor:**reactor-core:3.3.8.RELEASE**
* org.reactivestreams:**reactive-streams:1.0.3**

=== API Affecting
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JCBC-1681[JCBC-1681]: 
Removed cas from `IncrementOptions` and `DecrementOptions`.  
CAS is not supported by the underlying protocol and should not have been exposed in these options.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JCBC-1625[JCBC-1625]: 
Deprecated `maxTTL` on BucketSettings in favor of `maxExpiry`.

=== Bug Fixes
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JCBC-1647[JCBC-1647]: 
Deprecated `EjectionPolicy` in favor of `EvictionPolicyType`.
And added the "noEviction" and "nruEviction" policies used by ephemeral buckets.
This fixed a but where the BucketManager didn't recognize ephemeral bucket ejection values.
Users can now set a non-default ejection policy when creating an ephemeral bucket.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JCBC-1668[JCBC-1668]: 
Fixes an NPE when `toString` or `fieldsAs` is called when no fields are present in the result. 
In this case just null should now be returned, instead of a NPE deep down in the Jackson serializer stack.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JVMCBC-870[JVMCBC-870]: 
A bug in the chunk response parser prohibited responses meant that View reduce responses were never completed, and as a result timed out on the user side.
The completion of view results with reduce enabled has now been fixed.

=== Enhancements
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JCBC-1661[JCBC-1661], https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JCBC-1665[JCBC-1665]: 
Building on the expiry improvements in the previous release, this adds a new `expiryTime()` method that returns expiry as an `Instant`, which better expresses the concept than the `Duration` returned by `expiry()`.  
The latter will be deprecated in a future release.  
Similarly, everywhere a `Duration`-based expiry could be provided previously, an overload has been added to take an `Instant`-based expiry.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JCBC-1666[JCBC-1666]: 
Made `bucket.scope("_default").collection("_default")` behave just like `bucket.defaultCollection()`.
`AsyncScope.collection()` now no longer refreshes collection map for default collection.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JCBC-1670[JCBC-1670]: 
Added WaitUntilReadyOptions.serviceTypes() overload that accepts varargs.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JVMCBC-867[JVMCBC-867]: 
Performance improvement: do not grab ByteBuf slice when extracting server response time.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JVMCBC-869[JVMCBC-869]: 
Maintenance dependency bump: Netty -> 4.1.51, Jackson -> 2.11.1, Reactor -> 3.3.7, OpenTelemetry -> 0.6.0.

== Version 3.0.6 (14 July 2020)

Version 3.0.6 is the seventh release of the 3.0 series, bringing enhancements and bugfixes over the last stable release.

http://packages.couchbase.com/clients/java/3.0.6/Couchbase-Java-Client-3.0.6.zip[Download] |
https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-java-client-3.0.6/index.html[API Reference] |
http://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-core-io-2.0.7/[Core API Reference]

The supported and tested dependencies for this release are:

* com.couchbase.client:**java-client:3.0.6**
* com.couchbase.client:**core-io:2.0.7**
* io.projectreactor:**reactor-core:3.3.5.RELEASE**
* org.reactivestreams:**reactive-streams:1.0.3**

=== Enhancements
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JCBC-1645[JCBC-1645]:
Specifying document expiries has been made significantly easier.
Expiries are supplied as a `Duration`.  
The new behaviour is that if that duration is less than 50 years, then it will be interpreted as being a relative timestamp from the current time.
E.g. `Duration.ofDays(35)` will expire in 35 days time.
(Previously, a `Duration` longer than 30 days would be interpreted as being an epoch time.
Unless this epoch time occurred in the future then it would expire immediately.
In order to preserve compatibility for users that worked around this behaviour, any `Duration` longer than 50 years will continue to be interpreted as an epoch time.)
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JCBC-1632[JCBC-1632]:
Bootstrapping is now fully pipelined for performance, building on the improvements in the previous release.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JVMCBC-865[JVMCBC-865]:
Changed the default idle timeout to 4.5s for http connections, to support performance improvements in query service.

=== Bug Fixes
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JCBC-1662[JCBC-1662]:
`MutateInMacro` for CRC32 is fixed.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JCBC-1664[JCBC-1664]:
`viewQuery` with `ViewOptions.viewOptions().keys(keys)` was returning a bad_request error.
This is now fixed.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JVMCBC-849[JVMCBC-849]:
Redundant global loading exceptions no longer propagated -- now logged at `debug` level.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JVMCBC-856[JVMCBC-856]:
A just-opened connection in pool no longer gets cleaned up prematurely .
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JVMCBC-858[JVMCBC-858]:
Channel writeAndFlush failures are no longer ignored.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JVMCBC-862[JVMCBC-862]:
Race condition with node identifier change on bootstrap identified.
New logic and some changes to the config provider code ensures that retry and resubscribe picks up fresh seed nodes.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JVMCBC-863[JVMCBC-863]:
Bucket-Level ping report no longer includes other view and KV services buckets.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JVMCBC-866[JVMCBC-866]:
Trailing : no longer added to IPv6 addresses without [].
'invalid IPv6 address' warnings now no longer produced when trying to connect to a valid Ipv6 address thus specified.

=== Bug Fixes

* http://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JVMCBC-845[JVMCBC-845]:
If a rebalance is stopped in the middle, an edge case occasionally causes KV ops to time out as the fast forward map is chosen over the retry.
The behavior has now been changed so that the client will try the old and new servers to make sure the operation eventually gets dispatched to the right node.
* http://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JCBC-1626[JCBC-1626]:

Exposed API to set the collections TTL.
CreateCollection CollectionSpec now includes `MaxTTL`.
* http://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JCBC-1617[JCBC-1617]:
Attempting to work with the collection manager on clusters where collections are not available (or enabled as a DP) will now result in a `FeatureNotAvailable` failure.
* http://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JVMCBC-830[JVMCBC-830]:
Added more convenient overloads for SecurityConfig and CertAuth.
These overloads initialize both the SecurityConfig and the CertificateAuthenticator directly from a KeyStore or TrustStore.
* http://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JVMCBC-831[JVMCBC-831]:
Improves timeout for waitUntilReady -- the `waitUntilReady` helper should now throw a proper timeout exception.
* http://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JVMCBC-832[JVMCBC-832]:

* http://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JVMCBC-835[JVMCBC-835]:
Using "localhost:8091" as a connection string would set the kv bootstrap port to 8091, which is not desired behavior.
To prevent this from happening again, the code now checks for this condition, fails fast, and also provides guidance on what the connection string should look like instead.
* http://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JVMCBC-836[JVMCBC-836]:

Named fields in SearchRows results are now deserialized.
* http://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JVMCBC-834[JVMCBC-834]:
'CollectionNotFoundException' now triggers a retry, and if no collection refresh is currently in progress it will proactively trigger a new one.
Now Docs created under custom collection should no longer raise an exception when a collection has been created in the meantime, but the collection is not found as no refresh is in progress.
* http://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JVMCBC-826[JVMCBC-826]:
A NullPointerException was occuring when LDAP is enabled.
The code now explicitly fails the connection with a descriptive error message instructing the user what to do next (either use TLS which is preferred) or enable PLAIN on the password authenticator (insecure).
* http://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JVMCBC-827[JVMCBC-827]:
Search query results row_hit typo resulted in 0 being returned for total rows. 
This has now been fixed. 
* http://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JVMCBC-828[JVMCBC-828]:
