{description}
Even the most reliable software and hardware might fail at some point, and along with the failures, introduce a chance of data loss.
Couchbaseâ€™s durability features include Synchronous Replication, and the possibility to use distributed, multi-document ACID transactions.
It is the responsibility of the development team and the software architect to evaluate the best choice for each use case.
