Management operations in the Java SDK may be performed through several interfaces depending on the object:

== Creating and Removing Buckets

To create or delete a bucket, call the bucket manager with the `buckets()` call on the cluster:

[source,java]
----
include::example$BucketsAndClustersExample.java[tag=buckets_and_clusters_1,indent=0]
----

// The `BucketSettings` can be created via a builder, [.api]`DefaultBucketSettings.builder()`.
This class is also used to expose information about an existing bucket (`manager.getBucket(string)`) or to update an existing bucket (`manager.updateBucket(bucketSettings)`). 

The default Collection & Default Scope will be used automatically.
