The Couchbase Java SDK allows Java applications to access a Couchbase cluster. It offers synchronous APIs as well as reactive and asynchronous equivalents to maximize flexibility and performance.

The Couchbase Java SDK 3._x_ is a complete rewrite of the 2.x API, providing a simpler surface area and adding support for future Couchbase Server features like Collections and Scopes (available in Couchbase Server 6.5 as a xref:concept-docs:collections.adoc[developer preview]).
The (reactive) API also migrated from `RxJava` to `Reactor`, along with other improvements to performance, logging, debugging and timeout troubleshooting.
If you're upgrading your application from Java SDK 2.x, please read our xref:project-docs:migrating-sdk-code-to-3.n.adoc[Migrating 2.x code to SDK 3.0 Guide].

== Installing the SDK

At least Java 8 is required for current releases;
see the xref:project-docs:compatibility.adoc#jdk-compat[Compatibility] section for details.
We recommend running the latest Java LTS version (i.e. at the time of writing JDK 11) with the highest patch version available.

Couchbase publishes all stable artifacts to https://search.maven.org/search?q=com.couchbase.client[Maven Central].
The latest version (as of April 2021) is https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.couchbase.client/java-client/3.1.4/jar[3.1.4].

You can use your favorite dependency management tool to install the SDK.
The following snippet shows how to do it with https://maven.apache.org/[maven].

[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.couchbase.client</groupId>
        <artifactId>java-client</artifactId>
        <version>3.1.4</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

For https://gradle.org/[gradle], you can use:

[source,groovy]
----
implementation 'com.couchbase.client:java-client:3.1.4'
----

Alternatively, we provide a zip file with all the dependencies bundled if you wish to manually include the `jar` files in your classpath. Refer to the xref:project-docs:sdk-release-notes.adoc[Release Notes] for further details. You can also find links to the hosted javadocs there.

== Hello Couchbase

Once you have the Java client installed, open your IDE, and try out the following:

[source,java]
----
include::example$StartUsing.java[tag=connect,indent=0]
----

Couchbase uses xref:6.5@server:learn:security/roles.adoc[Role Based Access Control (RBAC)] to control access to resources.
Here we will use the _Full Admin_ role created during installation of the Couchbase Data Platform.
For production client code, you will want to use more appropriate, restrictive settings -- but here we want to get you up and running quickly.
If you're developing client code on the same VM or machine as the Couchbase Server, your connection string can be just `localhost`.

The `Cluster` provides access to cluster-level operations like N1Ql queries, analytics or full-text search. You will also find different management APIs on it.

If you are not using an IDE or are new to java, the following imports are necessary to build the following snippets:

[source,java]
----
include::example$StartUsing.java[tag=imports,indent=0]
----

To access the KV (Key/Value) API or to query views, you need to open a `Bucket`:

[source,java]
----
include::example$StartUsing.java[tag=bucket,indent=0]
----

If you installed the travel-sample` data bucket, substitute _travel-sample_ for _bucket-name_.

The 3.0 SDK is ready for the introduction of xref:concept-docs:collections.adoc[Collections] in an upcoming release of the Couchbase Data Platform.
The latest release, Couchbase Server 6.5, brings a limited _Developer Preview_ of Collections, allowing Documents to be grouped by purpose or theme, according to specified _Scope_.
Here we will use the `defaultCollection`, which covers the whole Bucket and _must be used when connecting to a 6.5 cluster or earlier_.

[source,java]
----
include::example$StartUsing.java[tag=collection,indent=0]
----

KV Operations are described in detail on the xref:howtos:kv-operations.adoc[KV Operations page], but to get you started the following code creates a new document and then fetches it again, printing the result.

[source,java]
----
include::example$StartUsing.java[tag=upsert-get,indent=0]
----

You can also perform a N1QL query at the cluster level:

[source,java]
----
include::example$StartUsing.java[tag=n1ql-query,indent=0]
----

You can learn more about N1QL queries on the xref:howtos:n1ql-queries-with-sdk.adoc[Query page]. 
Other services (like analytics, search or views) work very similar to the two shown above. 
Please refer to their respective documentation sections to learn more.

Couchbase Cloud Sample::

If you are connecting to https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/index.html[Couchbase Cloud], be sure to get the correct endpoint as well as user, password, and `couchbasecloudbucket`  -- and see the <<cloud-connections, Cloud section>>, below.
During development, you may wish to use `.securityConfig(SecurityConfig.enableTls(true)` (commented out in the code sample below), 
for production use you will want to work with TLS using the Certificate provided by Couchbase Cloud -- 
see the xref:cloud:get-started:configure-cluster-access.adoc#allow-ip-address[downloading the certificate] section of the cloud connecting docs.

== Cloud Connections

For developing on Couchbase Cloud, if you are not working from the same _Availability Zone_, refer to the following:

* Notes on xref:ref:client-settings.adoc#constrained-network-environments[Constrained Network Environments], 
* xref:project-docs:compatibility.adoc#network-requirements[Network Requirements], 
* If you have a consumer-grade router which has problems with DNS-SRV records review our xref:howtos:troubleshooting-cloud-connections.adoc#troubleshooting-host-not-found[Troubleshooting Guide].


== Additional Resources

The API reference is generated for each release and the latest can be found http://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-java-client/[here].
Older API references are linked from their respective sections in the xref:project-docs:sdk-release-notes.adoc[Release Notes].

Couchbase welcomes community contributions to the Java SDK.
The Java SDK source code is available on https://github.com/couchbaselabs/couchbase-jvm-clients[GitHub].

If you are planning to use Spring Data Couchbase, see the xref:project-docs:compatibility.adoc#spring-compat[notes on version compatibility].
