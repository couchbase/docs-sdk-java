Discover how to program interactions with the Couchbase Server via the data, Query, and search services -- using the Travel Sample Application with the built-in Travel Sample data Bucket.

include::6.5@sdk:shared:partial$sample-application.adoc[tag=prereq]


== Preparation

As well as the xref:start-using-sdk.adoc[Java SDK 3.0] and Couchbase Server, 
set up as described above, you will need `git` to fetch the travel sample application code:

[source,console]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/couchbaselabs/try-cb-java.git
----

Change directory into your cloned repository, and check out the latest branch (this will most probably be enabled as the default branch).

[source,console]
----
$ git checkout 6.5
----


== Running the Travel Sample Application

Next, edit the `storage.host` field in src/main/resources/application.properties to the one for your containerised Couchbase Server (or localhost, 127.0.0.1, if appropriate), and any other local changes -- such as password.
From here onwards, we'll assume the defaults.

And run with

[source,console]
----
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----

Most likely, you'll want to open up your preferred IDE for the `storage.host` step, 
and stay there to build the app, rather than running Maven from the command line.

After the build, you should see messages from `Tomcat` and `trycb.Application`, which tells you that you've been successful.
With your Web browser of choice, head to port 8080 of the local machine.

== Using the Sample App

Give yourself a username and password and click *Register*.

Now try out a few queries, and see Search in action for the hotel finder feature..


== Sample App Backend

The backend code shows Couchbase Java SDK in action with Query and Search, 
but also how to plug together all of the elements and build an application with Couchbase Server and the Java SDK.
Look at `User.java` to see some of the pieces necessary in most applications, such as the User `@Service`:

[source,java]
----
@Service
public class User {

    private final TokenService jwtService;

    @Autowired
    public User(TokenService jwtService) {
        this.jwtService = jwtService;
    }

    static final String USERS_COLLECTION_NAME = "users";
    static final String FLIGHTS_COLLECTION_NAME = "flights";
----

Creating a user shows the typical security concerns, with salted password hashes, as well as the mundane but essential business of using the KV interface to `insert` the username into the database:

[source,java]
----
    public Result<Map<String, Object>> createLogin(final Bucket bucket, final String username, final String password,
            DurabilityLevel expiry) {
        String passHash = BCrypt.hashpw(password, BCrypt.gensalt());
        JsonObject doc = JsonObject.create()
            .put("type", "user")
            .put("name", username)
            .put("password", passHash);
        InsertOptions options = insertOptions();
        if (expiry.ordinal() > 0) {
            options.durability(expiry);
        }
        String narration = "User account created in document " + username + " in bucket " + bucket.name()
                + (expiry.ordinal() > 0 ? ", with expiry of " + expiry.ordinal() + "s" : "");

        try {
            bucket.defaultCollection().insert(username, doc, options);
            return Result.of(
                    JsonObject.create().put("token", jwtService.buildToken(username)).toMap(),
                    narration);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            throw new AuthenticationServiceException("There was an error creating account");
        }
    }
----

Here, the _flights_ array, containing the flight IDs, is converted to actual objects:

[source,java]
----
        Collection flightsCollection = bucket.defaultCollection();
        List<Map<String, Object>> results = new ArrayList<Map<String, Object>>();
        for (int i = 0; i < flights.size(); i++) {
            String flightId = flights.getString(i);
            GetResult res;
            try {
                res = flightsCollection.get(flightId);
            } catch (DocumentNotFoundException ex) {
                throw new RuntimeException("Unable to retrieve flight id " + flightId);
            }
            Map<String, Object> flight = res.contentAsObject().toMap();
            results.add(flight);
        }
        return results;
    }
----


== Data Model
