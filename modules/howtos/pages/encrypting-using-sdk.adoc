= Field Level Encryption from the Java SDK
:page-topic-type: howto
:page-edition: Enterprise Edition

[abstract]
Field Level Encryption is available in Couchbase Data Platform 5.5, from Java SDK version 2.6.0

This library adds support for Field-Level Encryption (FLE) to the Couchbase
Java SDK. It includes cryptographic algorithms and keyrings
you can use out of the box, and provides a framework for implementing
your own crypto components.

Version `3.0.0-pre.1` of this library requires Couchbase Java SDK version `3.0.5` or later.

== Packaging

The Couchbase Java SDK uses the https://github.com/couchbase/java-couchbase-encryption[java-couchbase-encryption^] library to provide support for encryption and decryption of JSON fields.

NOTE: This separation of the encryption library ensures that the SDK does not have a dependency upon an encryption library in general use -- but it does mean you have to explicitly include this external dependency in your project configuration. See the xref:#_example[example project].

The Couchbase Java Field Level Encryption (FLE) uses entity annotations/`JsonObject` methods to specify which field(s) to apply encryption and which algorithm to use.

=== Optional Dependencies

To reduce the footprint of this library, some of its dependencies
are optional. Using certain features requires adding additional dependencies
to your project.

HashiCorp Vault Transit integration requires [Spring Vault](https://docs.spring.io/spring-vault/docs/current/reference/html/):

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.vault</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-vault-core</artifactId>
    <version>2.2.2.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
----

== Configuration

To enable Field-Level Encryption, supply a `CryptoManager` when configuring
the Java SDK's `ClusterEnvironment`.

[source,java]
----
include::example$encrypting_using_sdk.java[tag=encrypting_using_sdk_1,indent=0];
----

== Usage

Two modes of operation are available: transparent encryption/decryption
during Jackson data binding, and manual field editing using `JsonObjectCrypto`.

=== Data Binding

Sensitive fields of your POJOs can be annotated with `@Encrypted`.
Let's use this class as an example:

[source,java]
----
include::example$encrypting_using_sdk.java[tag=encrypting_using_sdk_2,indent=0];
----

Now let's create an employee record:

[source,java]
----
include::example$encrypting_using_sdk.java[tag=encrypting_using_sdk_3,indent=0];
----

You can get the document as a `JsonObject` to verify the field was encrypted:

[source,java]
----
include::example$encrypting_using_sdk.java[tag=encrypting_using_sdk_4,indent=0];
----

Because `contentAsObject()` does not decrypt anything, the expected output
is something like:

[source,json]
----
{
  "encrypted$replicant": {
    "alg": "AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA512",
    "ciphertext": "xwcxyUyZ.....",
    "kid": "myKey"
  }
}
----

Now let's read the employee record using data binding:

[source,java]
----
include::example$encrypting_using_sdk.java[tag=encrypting_using_sdk_5,indent=0];
----

This prints `true`.

==== Using a custom ObjectMapper

The code that enables encryption/decryption during data binding is packaged
as a Jackson module called `EncryptionModule`. You can register this module
with any Jackson `ObjectMapper`.

You'll need to do this if you want to supply your own customized ObjectMapper
for the Java SDK to use when serializing documents. Here's how to configure
the cluster environment to use a a custom JSON serializer backed by your own
ObjectMapper with support for Field-Level Encryption:

[source,java]
----
include::example$encrypting_using_sdk.java[tag=encrypting_using_sdk_6,indent=0];
----

=== JsonObjectCrypto

If you need more control of which fields get decrypted, or if you prefer
working with the Couchbase `JsonObject` tree model, you can use
a `JsonObjectCrypto` instance to read and write encrypted field values
of a `JsonObject`.

[source,java]
----
include::example$encrypting_using_sdk.java[tag=encrypting_using_sdk_7,indent=0];
----

== Creating Encryption Keys

The AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA512 algortihm included in this library uses
encryption keys that are 64 bytes long.

Here's an example that shows how to create a Java key store file containing
a suitable encryption key:

[source,java]
----
include::example$encrypting_using_sdk.java[tag=encrypting_using_sdk_8,indent=0];
----

And here's how to use that file to create a `Keyring` for use with
Couchbase Field-Level Encryption:
[source,java]
----
include::example$encrypting_using_sdk.java[tag=encrypting_using_sdk_9,indent=0];
----
