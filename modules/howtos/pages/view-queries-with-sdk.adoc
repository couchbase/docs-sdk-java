= MapReduce Views Using the Java SDK with Couchbase Server

[abstract]
You can use MapReduce views to create queryable indexes in Couchbase Server.

WARNING: Although still maintained and supported for legacy use, Views date from the earliest days of Couchbase Server development, and as such are rarely the best choice over, say, xref:n1ql-queries-with-sdk.adoc[our Query service] for your application, see xref:concept-docs:data-services.adoc[our guide to choosing the right service].

== Querying Views

View operations are accessible on the `Bucket` API. 
Once you have a reference to the bucket you need to at least supply the name of the design document and the name of the view:

[source,java]
----
include::example$Views.java[tag=views-simple,indent=0]
----

It is important to remember that by default, the SDK will look for a view deployed to the production namespace. 
If you want to query one which is still in the development namespace you can do it like this:

[source,java]
----
include::example$Views.java[tag=views-dev,indent=0]
----

In the same way you can supply all kinds of different options, including the `ViewScanConsistency` which was previously called `Stale`.

[source,java]
----
include::example$Views.java[tag=views-opts,indent=0]
----

If you have a `reduce` function in your view and you want to call it, make sure to call `.reduce(true)` as well.

== Working with View Rows

A `ViewResult` can emit 0 to N view rows. 
The available data inside each `ViewRow` depends both on the map function written and if a reduce function is used.

The structure of a `ViewRow` looks like this:

[source,java]
----
public class ViewRow {
  public Optional<String> id() { /* ... */ }

  public <T> Optional<T> keyAs(Class<T> target) { /* ... */ }

  public <T> Optional<T> keyAs(TypeRef<T> target) { /* ... */ }

  public <T> Optional<T> valueAs(Class<T> target) { /* ... */ }

  public <T> Optional<T> valueAs(TypeRef<T> target) { /* ... */ }
}
----

Both the `key` and the `value` can be converted into any target type, depending on how you wrote your view function. 
Note that the document ID is always a `String`, but it is wrapped in an `Optional` because it is not available if a reduce function is used.

== Accessing View Metadata

In addition to the rows the view result contains additional `ViewMetaData`.

[source,java]
----
include::example$Views.java[tag=views-meta,indent=0]
----

The number of rows is always present, the debug information only if you enable it on the `ViewOptions` as indicated through being wrapped into an `Optional<JsonObject>`.
