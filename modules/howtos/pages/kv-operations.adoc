[abstract]
Key Value (KV) or data service offers the simplest way to retrieve or mutate data where the key is known.
Here we cover CRUD operations, document expiration, and optimistic locking with CAS.

The complete code sample used on this page can be downloaded from https://github.com/couchbase/docs-sdk-java/blob/release/3.0/modules/howtos/examples/KvOperations.java[here].

At its heart Couchbase Server is a high-performance key-value store, and the key-value interface outlined below is the fastest and best method to perform operations involving single documents.

A _document_ refers to an entry in the database (other databases may refer to the same concept as a _row_).
A document has an ID (_primary key_ in other databases), which is unique to the document and by which it can be located.
The document also has a value which contains the actual application data.
See xref:concept-docs:documents.adoc[the concept guide to _Documents_] for a deeper dive into documents in the Couchbase Data Platform.

Before proceeding, make sure you're familiar with the basics of authorization and connecting to a Cluster from the xref:hello-world:start-using-sdk.adoc[Start Using the SDK] section.

The code samples below will use these imports:

[TIP]
.N1QL vs. Key-Value
====
N1QL can also be used to perform many single-document operations but we very strongly recommend using the key-value API for this instead, as it can be much more efficient. The request can go directly to the correct node, there's no query parsing overhead, and it's over the highly optimized memcached binary protocol.
====

== JSON
The Couchbase Server is a key-value store that's agnostic to what's stored, but it's very common to store JSON so most of the examples below will focus on that use-case.

The Java SDK provides you with several options for working with JSON.

If you pass any object (like the provided `JsonObject` and `JsonArray`), including `Map<String, Object>` or `List<Object>` into the APIs provided, 
the SDK will use its internal JSON codec (utilizing https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson]) to encode/decode those objects transparently. 
The SDK also supports custom transcoders and serializers which are covered separately.

== Upsert

[TIP]
.Sub-Document Operations
====
All of these operations involve fetching the complete document from the Cluster.
Where the number of operations or other circumstances make bandwidth a significant issue, 
the SDK can work on just a specific _path_ of the document with xref:subdocument-operations.adoc[Sub-Document Operations].
====

Here is a simple upsert operation, which will insert the document if it does not exist, or replace it if it does.

We'll use the built-in JSON types for simplicity, but you can use different types if you want.

[source,java]
----
include::example$KvOperations.java[tag=upsert]
----

[NOTE]
=====
All the examples here use the Java SDK's simplest API, which blocks until the operation is performed. 
There's also an asynchronous API that is based around Java's `CompletableFuture`, 
and a reactive API built around https://projectreactor.io/[Project Reactor]. 
They can be accessed like this:

[source,java]
----
include::example$KvOperations.java[tag=apis]
----
=====

== Insert
Insert works very similarly to upsert, but will fail if the document already exists with a `DocumentExistsException`:

[source,java]
----
include::example$KvOperations.java[tag=insert]
----

== Retrieving documents

We've tried upserting and inserting documents into Couchbase Server, let's get them back:

[source,java]
----
include::example$KvOperations.java[tag=get-simple]
----

Of course if we're getting a document we probably want to do something with the content:

[source,java]
----
include::example$KvOperations.java[tag=get]
----

Once we have a `GetResult`, we can use `contentAsObject()` to turn the content back into a `JsonObject` like we inserted it in the examples before, 
or use the more generic `contentAs(T.class)` equivalent to turn it back into other entity structures. 
In fact, the `contentAsObject()` method is just a convenience method for `contentAs(JsonObject.class)`.

== Replace
A very common sequence of operations is to `get` a document, modify its contents, and `replace` it.

[source,java]
----
include::example$KvOperations.java[tag=replace]
----

We `upsert` an initial version of the document. 
We don't care about the exact details of the result, just whether it succeeded or not, so do not assign a return value. 
Then we `get` it back into `doc` and pull out the document's content as a `JsonObject` using `contentAs`. 
Afterwards, we update a field in the `JsonObject` with `put`.  `JsonObject` is mutable, we don't need to store the result of the `put`. 
Finally, we `replace` the document with the updated content, and a CAS value, storing the final result as `result`.

So, what is CAS?

CAS, or Compare And Swap, is a form of optimistic locking. Every document in Couchbase has a CAS value, and it's changed on every mutation. 
When you `get` a document you also get the document's CAS, and then when it's time to write the document, you send the same CAS back. 
If another thread or program has modified that document in the meantime, the Couchbase Server can detect you've provided a now-outdated CAS, and return an error. 
This provides cheap, safe concurrency. 
See xref:concurrent-document-mutations.adoc[this detailed description of CAS] for further details.

In general, you'll want to provide a CAS value whenever you `replace` a document, to prevent overwriting another agent's mutations.

== Retrying on CAS failures

But if we get a CAS mismatch, we usually just want to retry the operation. 
Let's see a more advanced `replace` example that shows one way to handle this:

[source,java]
----
include::example$KvOperations.java[tag=replace-retry]
----

Note that this code is simplistic to show how CAS retry works in general. 
If the `replace()` above never works, you would always get a CAS mismatch, and never break out of the loop - so 
`for(int i = 0; i < maxAttempts; i++)` would be a resaonable alternative.

In later chapters we cover more sophisticated approaches to this, including asynchronous retry, retry with backoff and bailing out after a maximum amount of tries. 
All these should be in place for robust, production ready code.

== Removing
Removing a document is straightforward:

[source,java]
----
include::example$KvOperations.java[tag=remove]
----

Like `replace`, `remove` also optionally takes the CAS value if you want to make sure you are only removing the document if it hasn't changed since you last fetched it.

== Durability
Writes in Couchbase are written to a single node, and from there the Couchbase Server will take care of sending that mutation to any configured replicas.

The optional `durability` parameter, which all mutating operations accept, allows the application to wait until this replication (or persistence) is successful before proceeding.

It can be used like this:

[source,java]
----
include::example$KvOperations.java[tag=durability]
----

If no argument is provided the application will report success back as soon as the primary node has acknowledged the mutation in its memory. 
However, we recognize that there are times when the application needs that extra certainty that especially vital mutations have been successfully replicated, 
and the other durability options provide the means to achieve this.

The options differ depend on what Couchbase Server version is in use. 
If 6.5 or above is being used, you can take advantage of the xref:concept-docs:durability-replication-failure-considerations.adoc#durable-writes[Durable Write] feature, 
in which Couchbase Server will only return success to the SDK after the requested replication level has been achieved. 
The three replication levels are:

 * `Majority` - The server will ensure that the change is available in memory on the majority of configured replicas.
 * `MajorityAndPersistToActive` - Majority level, plus persisted to disk on the active node.
 * `PersistToMajority` - Majority level, plus persisted to disk on the majority of configured replicas.

The options are in increasing levels of safety. 
Note that nothing comes for free - for a given node, waiting for writes to storage is considerably slower than waiting for it to be available in-memory.
These trade offs, as well as which settings may be tuned, are discussed in the xref:concept-docs:durability-replication-failure-considerations.adoc#durable-writes[durability page].

If a version of Couchbase Server lower than 6.5 is being used then the application can fall-back to 'client verified' durability. 
Here the SDK will do a simple poll of the replicas and only return once the requested durability level is achieved. 
This can be achieved like this:

[source,java]
----
include::example$KvOperations.java[tag=durability-observed]
----

To stress, durability is a useful feature but should not be the default for most applications, as there is a performance consideration, 
and the default level of safety provided by Couchbase will be reasonable for the majority of situations.

== Document Expiration
Couchbase Server includes an option to have particular documents automatically expire after a set time. 
This can be useful for some use-cases, such as user sessions, caches, or other temporary documents.

You can set an expiry value when creating a document:

[source,java]
----
include::example$KvOperations.java[tag=expiry-insert]
----

When getting a document, the expiry is not provided automatically by Couchbase Server but it can be requested:

[source,java]
----
include::example$KvOperations.java[tag=expiry-get]
----

Note that when updating the document, special care must be taken to avoid resetting the expiry to zero. 
Here's how:

[source,java]
----
include::example$KvOperations.java[tag=expiry-replace]
----

Some applications may find `getAndTouch` useful, which fetches a document while updating its expiry field. 
It can be used like this:

[source,java]
----
include::example$KvOperations.java[tag=expiry-touch]
----

Working on just a specific path within a JSON document will reduce network bandwidth requirements -- see the xref:subdocument-operations.adoc[Sub-Document] pages.

For a significant performance speed up with large volumes of data, reference our xref:concurrent-async-apis.adoc[asynchronous programmaing options].

Another way of increasing network performance is to _pipeline_ operations with xref:concurrent-async-apis.adoc#batching[Batching Operations].

As well as various xref:concept-docs:data-model.adoc[Formats] of JSON, Couchbase can work directly with xref:concept-docs:nonjson.adoc[arbitrary bytes, or binary format].

Our xref:n1ql-queries-with-sdk.adoc[Query Engine] enables retrieval of information using the SQL-like syntax of N1QL.
