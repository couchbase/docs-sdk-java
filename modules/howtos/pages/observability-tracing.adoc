{description}

To give insight into a request/response flow, the SDK provides a `RequestTracer` interface and ships with both a default implementation as well as modules that can be plugged into feed the traces to external systems (including OpenTelemetry).


== The Default ThresholdLoggingTracer

By default, the SDK will emit information about requests that are over a configurable threshold every 10 seconds. 
Note that if no requests are over the threshold no event / log will be emitted.

It is possible to customize this behavior by modifying the configuration:

[source,java]
----
include::example$Tracing.java[tag=tracing-configure,indent=0]
----

In this case the emit interval is one minute and Key/Value requests will only be considered if their latency is greater or equal than two seconds.

The JSON blob emitted looks similar to the following (prettified here for readability):

[source,json]
----
[
   {
      "top":[
         {
            "operation_name":"GetRequest",
            "server_us":2,
            "last_local_id":"E64FED2600000001/00000000EA6B514E",
            "last_local_address":"127.0.0.1:51807",
            "last_remote_address":"127.0.0.1:11210",
            "last_dispatch_us":2748,
            "last_operation_id":"0x9",
            "total_us":324653
         },
         {
            "operation_name":"GetRequest",
            "server_us":0,
            "last_local_id":"E64FED2600000001/00000000EA6B514E",
            "last_local_address":"127.0.0.1:51807",
            "last_remote_address":"127.0.0.1:11210",
            "last_dispatch_us":1916,
            "last_operation_id":"0x1b692",
            "total_us":2007
         }
      ],
      "service":"kv",
      "count":2
   }
]
----

For each service (e.g. Key/Value or Query) an entry exists in the outer JSON array. 
The top N (10 by default) slowest operations are collected and displayed, sorted by the total duration. 
This promotes quick visibility of the "worst offenders" and more efficient troubleshooting.

Please note that in future releases this format is planned to change for easier readability, 
so we do not provide any stability guarantees on the logging output format and it might change between minor versions.

A new, yet to be stabilized, format can be enabled by setting the `com.couchbase.thresholdRequestTracerNewOutputFormat` system property to `true`. 
More information will be provided as we get closer to stabilization.


== OpenTelemetry Integration
The built-in tracer is great if you do not have a centralized monitoring system, but if you already plug into the OpenTelemetry ecosystem we want to make sure to provide first-class support.

=== Exporting to OpenTelemetry
This method exports tracing telemetry in OpenTelemetry's standard format (OTLP), which can be sent to any OTLP-compatible receiver such as Jaeger, Zipkin or `opentelemetry-collector`.

Add this to your Maven, or the equivalent to your build tool of choice:

[source,xml]
----
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.opentelemetry</groupId>
            <artifactId>opentelemetry-bom</artifactId>
            <version>1.17.0</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.couchbase.client</groupId>
        <artifactId>tracing-opentelemetry</artifactId>
        <version>1.2.0</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.couchbase.client</groupId>
        <artifactId>metrics-opentelemetry</artifactId>
        <version>0.4.0</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.opentelemetry</groupId>
        <artifactId>opentelemetry-api</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.opentelemetry</groupId>
        <artifactId>opentelemetry-exporter-otlp</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.opentelemetry</groupId>
        <artifactId>opentelemetry-sdk</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

And now:

[source,java]
----
include::example$Tracing.java[tag=otel-direct,indent=0]
----

At this point the SDK will automatically be exporting spans, and you should see them in your receiver of choice.

=== OpenTelemetry Troubleshooting
* There are many ways to export spans.  The example is exporting OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) spans over GRPC to port 4317, which we believe is the defacto standard for OpenTelemetry.  Make sure that your receiver is compatible with this, e.g. has these ports open and is ready to receive OTLP traffic over GRPC.  With https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.41/getting-started/[Jaeger in Docker] this is achieved with the options `-e COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true` and `-p 4317:4317`.
* The exporter used in this example is `BatchSpanProcessor`, which may not have a chance to export spans if the application exits very quickly (e.g. a test application).  `SimpleSpanProcessor` can be used instead, though is not likely suitable for production.
* The example above uses `Sampler.alwaysOn()`, which exports every span.  This may need to be reduced to avoid overwhelming the receiver, with e.g. `Sampler.traceIdRatioBased(0.01)` to sample 1% of all traces.
* It can be worth sending traces into https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/[OpenTelemetry Collector], and forwarding them on from there to your receiver of choice.  Among other capabilities the collector can log traces it receives, making for easier debugging.

=== Parent spans

If you want to set a parent for a SDK request, you can do it in the respective `*Options`:

[source,java]
----
GetResult result = collection.get(
    "my-doc", 
    getOptions().parentSpan(OpenTelemetryRequestSpan.wrap(parentSpan))
)
----


== OpenTracing Integration

In addition to OpenTelemetry, we also provide support for OpenTracing for legacy systems which have not yet migrated to OpenTelemetry. 
Note that we still recommend to migrate eventually since OpenTracing has been sunsetted.

You need to include the `tracing-opentracing` module:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.couchbase.client</groupId>
    <artifactId>tracing-opentracing</artifactId>
    <version>0.3.3</version>
</dependency>
----

And then create an OpenTracing `Tracer` and pass it to the SDK:

[source,java]
----
ClusterEnvironment environment = ClusterEnvironment
    .builder()
    .requestTracer(OpenTracingRequestTracer.wrap(tracer))
    .build();
----
