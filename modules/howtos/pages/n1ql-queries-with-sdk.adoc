You can query for documents in Couchbase using the N1QL query language, a language based on SQL, but designed for structured and flexible JSON documents.
Querying can solve typical programming tasks such as finding a user profile by email address, facebook login, or user ID.

== Getting Started

After familiarizing yourself with the basics on how the N1QL query language works and how to query it from the UI you can use it from the Java SDK.

Before starting, here are all of the imports used in the following examples:

[source,java]
----
include::example$Queries.java[tag=imports,indent=0]
----

Here's a complete example of doing a query and handling the results:

[source,java]
----
include::example$Queries.java[tag=simple,indent=0]
----

Let's break it down. A query is always performed at the `Cluster` level, using the `query` method. It takes the statement as a required argument and then allows to provide additional options if needed (in the example above, no options are specified).

Once a result returns you can iterate the returned rows and/or accessing the `QueryMetaData` associated with the query. If something goes wrong during the execution of the query, a derivate of the `CouchbaseException` will be thrown that also provides additional context on the operation:

[source,console]
----
Exception in thread "main" com.couchbase.client.core.error.ParsingFailureException: Parsing of the input failed {"completed":true,"coreId":1,"errors":[{"code":3000,"message":"syntax error - at end of input"}],"idempotent":false,"lastDispatchedFrom":"127.0.0.1:56279","lastDispatchedTo":"127.0.0.1:8093","requestId":3,"requestType":"QueryRequest","service":{"operationId":"eee9b796-bfff-42dc-941d-1a985e019ff8","statement":"select 1=","type":"query"},"timeoutMs":75000,"timings":{"dispatchMicros":14381,"totalMicros":1365348}}
----

[NOTE]
.Open Buckets and Cluster-Level Queries
====
If you are using a cluster older than Couchbase Server 6.5, it is required that there is at least one bucket open before performing a cluster-level query. If you fail to do so, the SDK will return a `FeatureNotAvailableException` with a descriptive error message asking you to open one.
====


== Parameterized Queries

Supplying parameters as individual arguments to the query allows the query engine to optimize the parsing and planning of the query. 
You can either supply these parameters by name or by position.

The first example shows how to provide them by name:

[source,java]
----
include::example$Queries.java[tag=named,indent=0]
----

The second example by position:

[source,java]
----
include::example$Queries.java[tag=positional,indent=0]
----

What style you choose is up to you, for readability in more complex queries we generally recommend using the named parameters.

Note that you cannot use parameters in all positions. If you put it in an unsupported place the server will respond with a `PlanningFailureException` or similar.

== The Query Result

When performing a query, the response you receive is a `QueryResult`. 
If no exception gets raised the request succeeded and provides access to both the rows returned and also associated `QueryMetaData`.

Rows can be consumed either through a `JsonObject` directly, turned into a java collection instance (like a `Map`) or into your POJO of choice mapping directly to your domain logic.

[source,java]
----
include::example$Queries.java[tag=rowsasobject,indent=0]
----

The `QueryMetaData` provides insight into some basic profiling/timing information as well as information like the `clientContextId`.

.QueryMetaData
[options="header"]
|====
| Name       | Description
| `String requestId()` | Returns the request identifer of this request.
| `String clientContextId()` | Returns the context ID either generated by the SDK or supplied by the user.
| `QueryStatus status()` | An enum simply representing the state of the result.
| `Optional<QueryMetrics> metrics()` | Returns metrics provided by the query for the request if enabled.
| `Optional<JsonObject> signature()` | If a signature is present, it will be available to consume in a generic fashion.
| `List<QueryWarning> warnings()` | Non-fatal errors are available to consume as warnings on this method.
| `Optional<JsonObject> profile()` | If enabled returns additional profiling information of the query.
|====

For example, here is how you can print the `executionTime` of a query:

[source,java]
----
include::example$Queries.java[tag=printmetrics,indent=0]
----

== Query Options
The query service provides an array of options to customize your query. The following table lists them all:

.Available Query Options
[options="header"]
|====
| Name       | Description
| `clientContextId(String)` | Sets a context ID returned by the service for debugging purposes.
| `parameters(JsonArray)` | Allows to set positional arguments for a parameterized query.
| `parameters(JsonObject)` | Allows to set named arguments for a parameterized query.
| `priority(boolean)` | Assigns a different server-side priority to the query.
| `raw(String, Object)` | Escape hatch to add arguments that are not covered by these options.
| `readonly(boolean)` | Tells the client and server that this query is readonly.
| `adhoc(boolean)` | If set to false will prepare the query and later execute the prepared statement.
| `consistentWith(MutationState)` | Allows to be consistent with previously written mutations ("read your own writes").
| `maxParallelism(int)` | Tunes the maximum parallelism on the server.
| `metrics(boolean)` | Enables the server to send metrics back to the client as part of the response.
| `pipelineBatch(int)` | Sets the batch size for the query pipeline.
| `pipelineCap(int)` | Sets the cap for the query pipeline.
| `profile(QueryProfile)` | Allows to enable additional query profiling as part of the response.
| `scanWait(Duration)` | Allows to specify a maximum scan wait time.
| `scanCap(int)` | Specifies a maximum cap on the query scan size.
| `scanConsistency(QueryScanConsistency)` | Sets a different scan consistency for this query.
| `serializer(JsonSerializer)` | Allows to use a different serializer for the decoding of the rows.
|====

== Scan Consistency

By default, the query engine will return whatever is currently in the index at the time of query (this mode is also called `QueryScanConsistency.NOT_BOUNDED`). 
If you need to include everything that has just been written, a different scan consistency must be chosen. 
If `QueryScanConsistency.REQUEST_PLUS` is chosen, it will likely take a bit longer to return the results but the query engine will make sure that it is as up-to-date as possible.

[source,java]
----
include::example$Queries.java[tag=scanconsistency,indent=0]
----

You can also use `consistentWith(MutationState)` for a more narrowed-down scan consistency. 
Construct the `MutationState` from individual `MutationToken`s that are returned from KV `MutationResult`s to make sure at least those mutations are visible. 
Depending on the index update rate this might provide a speedier response.

[source,java]
----
include::example$Queries.java[tag=scanconsistency_with,indent=0]
----

Note that you cannot use this method and `scanConsistency(QueryScanConsistency)` at the same time, since they are mutually exclusive. 
As a rule of thumb, if you only care about being consistent with the mutation you just wrote on the same thread or app, use this method. 
If you need "global" scan consistency, use `QueryScanConsistency.REQUEST_PLUS` on `scanConsistency(QueryScanConsistency)`.


=== Client Context Id

The SDK will always send a client context ID with each query, even if none is provided by the user. 
By default a UUID will be generated that is mirrored back from the query engine and can be used for debugging purposes. 
A custom string can always be provided if you want to introduce application-specific semantics into it (so that for example in a network dump it shows up with a certain identifier). 
Whatever is chosen, we recommend making sure it is unique so different queries can be distinguished during debugging or monitoring.

[source,java]
----
include::example$Queries.java[tag=clientcontextid,indent=0]
----

=== Readonly

If the query is marked as readonly, both the server and the SDK can improve processing of the operation. 
On the client side, the SDK can be more liberal with retries because it can be sure that there are no state-mutating side-effects happening. 
The query engine will ensure that actually no data is mutated when parsing and planning the query.

[source,java]
----
include::example$Queries.java[tag=readonly,indent=0]
----

=== Custom JSON Serializer

Like with all JSON apis, it is possible to customize the JSON serializer. 
It allows to plug in your own library (like GSON) or custom configured mappings on your own Jackson serializer. 
This in turn makes it possible to serialize rows into POJOs or other structures that your application defines and the SDK has no idea about.

Please see the xref:transcoders-nonjson.adoc[documentation on transcoding and serialization] for more information.


== Reactive And Async APIs

In addition to the blocking API on `Cluster`, the SDK provides reactive and async APIs on `ReactiveCluster` or `AsyncCluster` respectively. 
If you are in doubt of which API to use, we recommend looking at the reactive first. 
It builds on top of reactor, a powerful library that allows you to compose reactive computations and deal with error handling and other related concerns (like retry) in an elegant manner. 
The async API on the other hand exposes a `CompletableFuture` and is more meant for lower level integration into other libraries or if you need the last drop of performance.

Also, there is another reason you want to use the reactive API: streaming large results with backpressure from the application side. 
Both the blocking and async APIs have no means of signalling backpressure in a good way, so if you need it the reactive API is your best option.

[TIP]
.Advanced Reactive Concepts Ahead
====
Please see the guides on reactive programming for more information on the basics, this guide is diving straight into their impact on querying.
====

A simple reactive query is similar to the blocking one:


[source,java]
----
include::example$Queries.java[tag=simplereactive,indent=0]
----

This query will stream all rows as they become available form the server. 
If you want to manually control the data flow (which is important if you are streaming a lot of rows which could cause a potential out of memory situation) you can do this by using explicit `request()` calls.

[source,java]
----
include::example$Queries.java[tag=backpressure,indent=0]
----

In this example we initially request a batch size of 10 rows (so streaming can begin). 
Then as each row gets streamed it is written to a `process()` method which does whatever it needs to do to process. 
Then a counter is decremented and once all of the 10 outstanding rows are processed another batch is loaded. 
Please note that if your `process()` method equivalent is blocking, like always with reactive code, you *must* move it onto another scheduler so that the I/O threads are not stalled. 
As always we recommend not blocking in the first place in reactive code.


== Querying at Scope Level

From version 3.0.8 of the Java SDK, it is possible to query off the xref:7.0@server:learn:data/scopes-and-collections.adoc[`Scope` level] _with the beta version of the next Couchbase Server release, 7.0β_,
using the `scope.query()` method.
It takes the statement as a required argument, and then allows additional options if needed.

CAUTION: This feature is marked xref:project-docs:compatibility.adoc#interface-stability[_Uncommitted_].
Expect a promotion to _Committed_ API in a future minor release.

A complete list of `QueryOptions` can be found in the https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-java-client/com/couchbase/client/java/AsyncScope.html#query-java.lang.String-[API docs].
