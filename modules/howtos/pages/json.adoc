= Choosing & Using a JSON Library
:page-topic-type: howto


Third-party JSON libraries are rarely necessary for most use cases with the Couchbase SDKs, and the default library will give you everything that you are likely to need.
Just xref:hello-world:start-using-sdk.html#hello-couchbase[get started] on your application and see.

NOTE: The xref:1.0@scala-sdk:howtos:json.adoc[Scala SDK supports multiple options for working with JSON], and has its own page covering this topic.
